A simple listview component for ReactJS that implements the concept of virtualization for effieciently rendering a huge dataset.

- Maintains a **constant number** of rendered items
- Does not rely on variables such as an element's dimensions or any of its styled properties (i.e. CSS positioning), eliminating the need for dynamic element measurement and any layout modifcations

# Rationale

While there are already rather amazing react components that implement virtualization techniques such as [React-Virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized), [React-Virtuoso](https://github.com/petyosi/react-virtuoso) and a lot more that I have yet to see, I have had difficulty in maintaining a variety of layouts and styles while using the above-mentioned libraries. Thus, React-StableList was developed with responsive design in mind.

# Usage

A [working example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-stablelist-demo-5duip?file=/src/App.js) is also available.

Install the package

```
npm i react-stablelist
```

then use the component somewhere in your react app or component

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import StableList from "react-stablelist";

/*
    your component must accept a "className" prop which will be used by
    StableList for index-specific operations
*/
const SpecialComponent = ({className, componentID}) => {
    return <div className={className} id={componentID}>...</div>
}

const App = () => {
   /**
     * @param {string} key a unique string that can be used as a component's "key" prop
     * @param {number} index the index of the element to be rendered relative to the dataset
     * @param {boolean} isFresh determines whether the component has just recently been rendered
     * @param {boolean} isFirstRender determines whether it is the component's first time being rendered
     * @param {any} propData the information that will be passed to the component as its props
    */
    const propProvider = (key, index, isFresh, isFirstRender, propData) => {
        return {
            // ...rest
            componentID: Math.random()
        }
    };

    const listData = [...];

    return (
        <StableList
            data={listData}
            dataKey={Math.random()}
            itemCount={listData.length}
            maxItems={60}
            threshold={20}
            component={SpecialComponent}
            propProvider={propProvider}
        />
    );
}

render(<App/>, document.getElementById("container"));
```

## Component Props

### Required Props

- **data**: An **array** containing the data to be used when building the components in the list
- **dataKey**: An identifier that uniquely identifes the current `data`.
- **itemCount**: The total number of items in the given data array.
- **maxItems**: The maximum number of items that can be rendered. (This prop defaults to **60** )
- **threshold**: The maximum number of items per batch. (This prop defaults to **20** )
- **component**: The component instance to be used as a list item.
- **propProvider**: A `function` that returns an object containing the props to be passed to a list item.
- **direction**: Determines whether the list should start building its list items from the start or the end of the given `data`. (This prop defaults to **top** )

### Optional Props

- **followNewItems**: A boolean that determines whether the list should be scrolled to the bottom when the `itemCount` prop's value changes.

### Methods

These methods can be accessed by passing a **ref** to the `StableList` component.

- **updateAtIndex(index)**: update a previously redered component instance at the given instance.

## Styling

Addtional styles can be applied to the component by extending the following classes:

- `.list-root`: The component's parent or root node
- `.scrolling-container`: The container of the list items
